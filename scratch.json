    "dungeon_room_approach": "The entrance to the Temple of the Reeds is hidden amidst a dense, swampy marshland. The path leading to it is treacherous and often submerged in murky waters. Travelers must navigate their way carefully, avoiding sinking and getting stuck in the mire. Additionally, the marsh is infested with poisonous insects that buzz ominously around, posing a threat to anyone who comes near.",
    "dungeon_room_dimensions": "The entrance to the dungeon is a small, crumbling stone archway, barely large enough for a single person to pass through. Beyond the archway lies a narrow corridor that leads deeper into the temple. The corridor is 20 feet long and 10 feet wide.",
    "unique_feature_extra_details": "If the players decide to examine the reeds that make up the temple walls, they will notice that they exude a sickly, greenish glow. This glow is the result of the corruption caused by the dark lizardfolk god. The reeds themselves are decayed and brittle, crumbling at the slightest touch.",
    "interactive_element_extra_details": "If the players choose to investigate the stone archway, they will discover a hidden pressure plate located just inside the entrance. This pressure plate triggers a trap in the form of a collapsing ceiling. If the players fail to disarm or avoid the trap, the consequences can vary depending on their response. If they react quickly and manage to avoid being crushed, they will only suffer minor injuries. However, if they are caught off guard, they may become pinned under the rubble, taking significant damage and potentially becoming trapped in the corridor.",
    "read_aloud_description": "The entrance to the Temple of the Reeds is a small, crumbling stone archway enveloped by dense, overgrown reeds. The air is thick with a musty odor, a mixture of decaying vegetation and stagnant water. The reeds sway ominously in the breeze, their sickly greenish glow casting eerie shadows on the path before you. As you approach the archway, you can see the reeds themselves are decayed and brittle, crumbling at the slightest touch."
