Lore
In the year 592, during a severe drought, the Lizardfolk tribe received a gift from their river deity - an abundance of reeds that they used to construct a massive temple. In 611, the Great Mender arrived and brought spiritual renewal to the temple, strengthening its connection to the river deity. In 660, a grand gathering was held at the temple, fostering unity among the Lizardfolk tribes. However, in 662, a cursed artifact caused the temple to collapse, shattering the tribe's faith. In 700, the Shadow Cult infiltrated the tribe, exploiting the weakened temple and planning to unleash a powerful shadow entity within.

The Lizardfolk temple is in a state of decay and uncertainty. The collapse of the temple has shaken the faith of the Lizardfolk, but some members still cling to hope. They are determined to reclaim their sacred temple and rid it of the curse. However, the Shadow Cult's presence poses a significant challenge. They seek to further corrupt the temple and unleash a malevolent shadow entity. The Lizardfolk must find a way to unite the tribe, regain their spiritual strength, and thwart the Shadow Cult's plans before it's too late.
